# SEM-3-Algorithms-and-Problem-Solving
Algorithm and Solving Project. The repository includes the project.

The project aims to allow casino managers to map their floor area in form a matrix (upto a precision of 100 x 100)
And then allows them to place their obstacles on a given point. The owners are then required to provide number of tables they would like to place and the code optimizes and shows the number of VIP (no neighbour) and normal tables that can be placed along with their placement on the matrix.

The code also calculates the minimum number of cameras required for a full coverage of the area.
The code allows customers to reserve tables according to the number of people.
Also the code uses and algorithm to calulates the change a person would recieve given an amount for chips in casino.


•	Accomplished placement of tables in a given area with pillars.
•	Accomplished optimizing the number of VIP and Normal Tables from a given number of tables in a given area.
•	Accomplished optimizing the number of cameras required to capture all the tables in the area. (CCTV module can survey surrounding 8 cells and the cell it is placed on).
•	Accomplished recognizing the number of the Denominations of Poker chips required for a given amount (in Thousand Dollars).  (Used Dynamic Programming)
•	Accomplished seat allocation and reservation. (A Problem of Bin Packing, Each table seats 4 people, Used Depth First Search Algorithm).
